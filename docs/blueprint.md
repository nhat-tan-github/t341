# **App Name**: Maze Explorer

## Core Features:

- Maze Generation: Generate a maze with a defined start and end point (treasure location).
- Pathfinding Algorithms: Implement A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Best-First Search algorithms for pathfinding.
- Visualization: Visualize the maze and the pathfinding process, highlighting the explored path and the final solution.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2c3e50) for the maze walls.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for the walkable path.
- Accent: Gold (#f1c40f) for the treasure location and the optimal path.
- Clear separation between the maze display and the algorithm selection/control panel.
- Use simple icons for start/end points and algorithm selection.
- Subtle animations to visualize the pathfinding process step-by-step.
